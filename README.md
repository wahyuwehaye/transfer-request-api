# Transfer Request Management API

This project facilitates the interaction between three distinct roles: the "Maker", the "Approver", and the "Admin", focusing on designing a system that efficiently handles transfer requests ensuring security and integrity.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js** - Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT** - For authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt** - For password hashing.

## Project Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB set up and running.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configuration

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the environment variables to match your development environment.

### 5. Running the server

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm start
```

### 6. Testing

We use **Jest** for unit and integration testing and **Supertest** for HTTP assertions.

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### 7. API Documentation

We employ **Swagger** for comprehensive API documentation detailing endpoints, validation, and usage instructions. Access the documentation at `/api-docs` on the running server.

## Deployment

Ensure you set environment variables according to the server environment. Deployment can be done on any server that supports Node.js (e.g., Heroku, Digital Ocean, AWS EC2).

## Directory Structure

Briefly, our project is structured as:

- `src/models` - Contains all the database models.
- `src/routes` - All the route definitions.
- `src/controllers` - Contains the logic for handling routes.
- `src/middleware` - Contains middlewares for things like authentication and error handling.
- `src/utils` - Utility functions and helpers.
- `src/config` - Configuration related things (like database connection).
- `tests` - Contains unit and integration tests.
- `docs` - Swagger API documentation related files.

## Dependencies

1. **express** - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
2. **mongoose** - Elegant mongodb object modeling for Node.js.
3. **jsonwebtoken** - An implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
4. **bcrypt** - A library to help you hash passwords.
5. **jest** - Delightful JavaScript Testing.
6. **supertest** - Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers.
7. **mongodb-memory-server** - Spinning up mongod in memory for fast tests. Perfect for unit tests.
8. **swagger-jsdoc** & **swagger-ui-express** - For Swagger documentation generation and UI.
